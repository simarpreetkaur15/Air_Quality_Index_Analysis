# Air_Quality_Index_Analysis

Objective:
Analyze the Air quality Index for any specific location for public health and environmental management.

Steps taken to analyze the data:
1. Looked at the intensity of each pollutant over time in air quality
2. Calculated AQI 
3. Analyzed AQI of Delhi over time
4. Looked at AQI category distribution
5. Looked at the distribution of pollutants in air quality
6. Found correlation between pollutants
7. Found hourly average trends in AQI
8. Found day of the week average trends in AQI

Insights:
1. Concentration of pollutants in air was highest on January 13th, 2023
2. Calculated and Categorized the Air Quality Index
3. Categorized the AQI in ‘Good’, ‘Moderate’, 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups', 'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy', 'Hazardous'
4. For ‘Jan 12th 2023’-’Jan 13th 2023’ the AQI was calculated to be 44 with it being in the Hazardous category.
5. Calculated the concentration of individual pollutants. CO (Carbon Monoxide) has the highest concentration (78.8%) and lowest concentration is 0.5466% for NH3 Pollutant. NH3 stands for Ammonia.
6. Correlation matrix plotted represents the correlation coefficients between different air pollutants in the dataset. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship 7. between two variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1. 
8. The positive correlations among CO, NO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, and NH3 suggest that they may share common sources or have similar pollution patterns, while O3 exhibits an inverse relationship with the other pollutants, which may be due to its role as both a pollutant and a natural atmospheric oxidant.
9. On Average the AQI is high between the hours 4 and 5. Similarly a pattern is noted that AQI is high on Wednesdays and Thursdays during the week.
